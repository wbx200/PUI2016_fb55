Compare the fit to the AGI to a fit to the income per person as endogenous variable  (*i.e.* redo your fit with income per person instead of AGI, see below how to derive income per person) and compare the fits. How do the fit compare? If the latter is better what does this say? If it is worse, what does this say?\n",
